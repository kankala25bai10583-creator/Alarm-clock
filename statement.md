 **Problem Statement**

In daily life, many people face difficulties waking up on time or remembering important tasks due to unreliable alarm methods. Mobile phone alarms may fail because of dead batteries, silent modes, or distractions, and traditional alarm clocks lack flexibility with features like multiple alarms or snooze options. This project aims to create a simple, dependable alarm clock application that reliably displays time and alerts the user with configurable alarms to improve punctuality and task management.

\- User-friendly interface for easy alarm configuration.

\- The project will not include advanced features like cloud synchronization, user accounts, or complex scheduling.



**Target Users**

\- Students needing morning wake-up and study reminders.

\- Professionals requiring alarms for meetings or breaks.

\- General users who want a straightforward, reliable alarm clock without extra distractions.



&nbsp;**High-level Features**

\- Real-time display of current time in 12-hour or 24-hour format.
